            <p class="text"> Color is a key principle for creating contrast in design these are colors that are distinct but complimentary.
                 It enhances readability and focus the viewer eyes on the subject that the sites intend to focus the users eye on. 
                 contrast goes beyond colors alone, it includes font size, the semantic use of font, visual hierarchy, image placement and content.
                The Amazon websites is an example of a website with good color contrast there are distinct between the foreground
                 and he background colors the different colors that are used are distinct and they complement themselves.</p>

            <p class="text">Alignment is the principle of design used to create structure organization and improve readability.
                it is the placement of items. Text, images, and much more on the webpage in an orderly manner.
                They could be vertically aligned horizontally aligned as long as the content portray their intended message in an organized and orderly manner.
                The Jumia webpage is a good example of a website that apply the principles of alignment
                the aligned their product in rows and column gave it good structure and organization</p>

            <P class="text"> This is one of the key principles of design not stacking up all the content on a webpage with no breathing space.
                 Its the process of allowing more whitespace between element of a design 
                 and appropriate padding between content and border to enhance the user experience with readability and increase comprehension. 
                 The IFMA home page is an example of a website that applied this principle of design.
                 there are sufficient white and empty space and enough padding between contents and borders.</P>
